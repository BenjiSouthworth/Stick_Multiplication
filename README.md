# Stick_Multiplication
This is an implementation of the Chinese Stick Multiplication in Python

Initially I saw a picture of stick multiplication on social media, and I found it very interesting. So I've decided to code a version of it in Python.
Mathmatical knowlegde of this implementation can be found below:

Eventually I would like to find a way to use Python to visualize the sticks for counting purposes.
